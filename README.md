# üíº Banking Transaction Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on analyzing transactional banking data using **SQL**. It simulates a mini core banking system with tables such as `customers`, `accounts`, `transactions`, and `branches`.

Through SQL queries, we extract valuable business insights including:
- Fraud detection
- Daily debit/credit reporting
- Customer lifetime value
- Customer ranking using window functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL (choose based on what you used)
- **Tools Used**: MySQL Workbench / VS Code / DBeaver / any SQL IDE
- **Output Format**: Exported to Excel (`.csv`) and showcased via screenshots

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

- `customers`: Stores basic customer information  
- `accounts`: Maps each customer to one or more bank accounts  
- `transactions`: Stores all credit/debit activity  
- `branches`: Details of each bank branch

## üìä Features Implemented

### 1. Fraud Detection  
Identifies large withdrawals (e.g., > ‚Çπ10,000) to highlight potentially suspicious transactions.

### 2. Daily Reports  
Generates a summary of daily debits and credits to monitor branch or bank-wide activity.

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value  
Calculates total credits - total debits to estimate customer contribution over time.

### 4. Ranking Customers  
Ranks customers by total transaction amount using `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`.
